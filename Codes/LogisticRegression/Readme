3. >>>run clean.py
4. >>>clean() #generate train_x_clean.bin and test_x_clean.bin
5. >>>run train.py
6. >>>fname = train() #saves pickle dump for trained model, 2-fold training and validation accuracy for two regularization parameters and returns filename of pickle dump.
7. >>>predict(fname) #loads pickle dump, and predictis using test_x_clean.bin. Final prediction is saved as 'finalPredictionLogistic.csv'
